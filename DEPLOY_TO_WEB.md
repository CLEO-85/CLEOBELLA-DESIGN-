## Share Your Website

Once deployed, you'll have a public URL like:
```
https://cleobella-desing.netlify.app
```

**Share it:**
- WhatsApp: Send the link to +243 8165712215
- Social media: Instagram, Facebook, TikTok
- Email: Send to customers
- Email signature: cleobella-desing.netlify.app

## Troubleshooting

**Images not showing after deploy?**
- Check file paths in script.js are correct (lines 12-48)
- Ensure images/ and videos/ folders are uploaded

**Forms not working?**
- Newsletter uses EmailJS (already configured) ✅
- Reviews & Comments save to browser (no server needed) ✅

## What About Data Storage?

Currently:
- **Reviews & Comments**: Saved in visitor's browser (localStorage)
- **Newsletter**: Sent via EmailJS to your email

To store data permanently (database):
- Use Firebase (free tier available)
- Use MongoDB Atlas
- Use Supabase

But this requires backend code - your current setup works without it!
